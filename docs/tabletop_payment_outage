# Tabletop exercise — Payment Gateway Outage (Day 11)

Objective
Run a 30–45 minute tabletop simulation to validate roles, communications, and decisions for a Payment Gateway outage scenario. Produce minutes, action items, and an updated risk register note.

Scenario (short)
At 10:00 UTC the primary payment gateway (Gateway A) begins returning intermittent timeouts and 502 errors for checkout calls. Customer payment failures spike to 8% and abandoned checkout increases. The outage may be partial or escalate to full downtime.

Scope
- Simulate detection → escalation → mitigation decision (failover to Gateway B or other mitigations) → communication plan.
- Focus on decision-making and responsibilities, not technical implementation.

Participants / roles (use these or map to real people)
- Project Lead (You): facilitator & scribe
- Ops Lead: executes operational actions (routing, monitoring)
- Dev Lead: implements config changes or toggles
- QA Lead: validates test transactions and monitors outcomes
- Support Lead: external-facing comms & customer handling
- Security/Legal (optional): regulatory or fraud concerns
- Executive / Sponsor (optional): approves go/no‑go for production changes

Agenda (30–45 minutes)
1. Context (5 min)
   - Read the scenario and confirm the scope & objectives.

2. Detection & initial triage (5–8 min)
   - How do we detect this? (alerts, monitoring, customer reports)
   - Who is notified? (alert routing / on-call)

3. Options & initial decisions (8–12 min)
   - What immediate mitigations are possible? (retry logic, queueing, circuit breaker, feature flag to redirect)
   - Is failover to Gateway B considered now or only if certain thresholds hit?
   - Who approves failover? (Accountable person / Executive)

4. Communication (5–8 min)
   - What do we tell customers and internal stakeholders?
   - Support scripts and social media guidance.

5. Escalation & follow-ups (5 min)
   - Actions to implement, owners, deadlines.
   - Decide on testing/PoC schedule (if not done now) and monitoring changes.

6. Close (2 min)
   - Confirm action items and who will update artifacts (risk register, mitigation tasks).

Injects (use during exercise to prompt decisions)
- Inject 1 (after Detection): "Payment failures up from 0.8% to 8% in 10 minutes; error logs show timeouts."
- Inject 2 (after Options): "Alternate gateway responds but with 20% higher latency; some test transactions time out."
- Inject 3 (after Comm): "A customer tweets about failed payment; support sees 15% increase in tickets."

Deliverables (after tabletop)
- docs/tabletop_minutes.md (detailed minutes)
- templates/tabletop_actions.csv (action items with owner and due date)
- Update artifacts/risk-register.csv entry for ID 1: add a short summary note and set Status as In Progress or Scheduled

Tips
- If running solo, play each role briefly and be explicit in the minutes about the role’s decisions.
- Timebox each agenda item to keep within 45 minutes.
- Record or timestamp the minutes so you can reference decisions later.

Use this tabletop to test communication and decision flow — it’s powerful evidence of process and stakeholder coordination for interviews.

# Day 1-30: Risk Management Project

Project: Risk Management for Small E‑commerce Service (payments + inventory)

This repo will be used for a 30-day learning and publishing plan to build a practical risk-management framework and artifacts for an e-commerce service.

Day 1 deliverables (added)
- docs/charter.md
- docs/GLOSSARY.md
- templates/RAID-template.csv
- templates/RACI-template.csv
- artifacts/risk-register.csv (initial 5 example risks)

How to view
- Open the files in the `docs/`, `templates/`, and `artifacts/` folders to follow progress.
- I will update this README each week with links to executive slides and the dashboard.

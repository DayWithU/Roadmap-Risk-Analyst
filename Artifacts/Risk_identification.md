# Risk identification — Short facilitation guide

Goal
Run a short session (30–60 minutes) to identify risks to the e‑commerce service (payments + inventory).

Preparation (5 mins)
- Open artifacts/risk-register.csv and share screen (or your sheet).
- Have a simple agenda: Context, Brainstorm, Clarify, Assign.

Agenda (30–60 mins)
1. Context (5 min)
   - Describe scope: checkout, payments, inventory sync, shipping.
   - State objective: capture 10–20 potential risks, assign owner and quick mitigation idea.

2. Brainstorm (15–30 min)
   - Ask participants to suggest risks (no judgement). Use prompts below.
   - Capture each suggestion as one line: Title, 1–2 sentence description, Category, Likelihood (1–5), Impact (1–5), Owner (role), Mitigation (short).

3. Clarify & prioritise (5–10 min)
   - For top 5 suggestions, confirm Likelihood and Impact, compute Score and Priority.
   - Assign Owners and next actions.

4. Close (5 min)
   - Agree next steps: update register, investigate high risks, schedule tabletop/exercise if needed.

Suggested prompts
- What could cause checkout failures? (third‑party, code, traffic)
- What external factors (suppliers/regulation) affect us?
- Where could customers experience loss (money, data, experience)?
- What single point of failure exists in the system?

Roles & outputs
- Scribe: captures each risk in the register (you can be this).
- Owner: person/role responsible for follow‑up.
- Deliverable: updated artifacts/risk-register.csv and a short list of top 3 actions.

Tips for beginners
- If you don’t have real stakeholders yet, simulate cross‑functional roles (Dev Lead, Ops Lead, Security Lead, Legal, Support).
- Keep risks short and concrete. Use your scoring doc (docs/scoring.md) for consistency.
- The goal is breadth on Day 3 — focus on getting realistic risks into the register.

After the session
- Mark top risks as "Review" or "Critical" and plan mitigation tasks in the next 1–2 days.
